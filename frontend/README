# PG Finder - Frontend

This is the frontend for the PG Finder application, designed specifically for TIMSCDR students to find verified PGs and for owners to list their properties.

## 🚀 Features Built

### 1. User Interface (UI)
* **Modern Design:** Clean and responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
* **Role Selection:** A "Who are you?" screen that lets users choose between **Student** and **Property Owner**.
* **Smart Navigation:**
    * **Login:** Takes users to a login form.
    * **Register:** Skips the login screen and takes users directly to the registration form.

### 2. Registration Flows
* **Student Registration:**
    * 3-Step Form: Basic Info, College Verification (ID Upload), and Preferences (Budget, Room Type).
* **Owner Registration:**
    * 3-Step Form: Contact Info, Property Details (Address, Distance), and Verification (Ownership Proof).
* **Success Screen:** A confirmation screen with confetti animation after successful signup.

### 3. Reusable UI Components
We created a set of reusable components in `src/components/ui/` for consistency:
* Buttons, Inputs, Labels, Textareas, and Select menus.
